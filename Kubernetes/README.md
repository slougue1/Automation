This repository is a fully containerized Kubernetes deployment pipeline for a cloud-native application hosted on AWS. It includes infrastructure-as-code provisioning with Terraform, secure EC2 instance setup, and automated deployment using kubectl and Helm. Secrets are managed securely, and the project supports scaling, load balancing, and persistent storage via EBS volumes. Designed for production-grade reliability, the configuration integrates IAM roles, VPC networking, and custom resource definitions (CRDs) to support modular growth and observability. Ideal for teams looking to replicate a secure, scalable deployment architecture on AWS using Kubernetes.
