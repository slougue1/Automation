This project sets up a complete Kubernetes environment on AWS to deploy and manage a cloud-based application. It includes Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure (EC2, VPC, security groups), and Kubernetes manifests for deploying containers, services, and persistent volumes. Secrets are handled securely, and the setup supports scaling, networking, and storage. Everything is automated to make deployment fast, repeatable, and production-ready.
